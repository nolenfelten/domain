# Domain

I wrote this script to check for availability of `.me` domains.  The
words are based on Loren Brichter`s Letterpress [dictionary](https://github.com/atebits/Words).

## How to start

Please check out `domain` file to see how to use this script.  Run the
script with `./domain`.  Obviously, before doing that, `bundle`
first.
